#Skip The Dishes - Delivery Scheduler
## Problem
Skip the Dishes is awesome in facilitating our life when we want to order great food without worries. However, we want to offer a different kind of feature and experience. Imagine if our customer could schedule a delivery for a specific place, date and time. This could be the beggining for recurring features like:
>  I would like to schedule a dish every single Friday

or
 
> I would love to receive a surprise dish every Wednesday

or for singles 

> It would be great if I could receive a cheap and healthy food every day at home. 

The Return of Investiment could be impressive because of the Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR). This iniciative could increase the customer engagement, since you have customer consuming products like plans. 

##Solution
The main idea is to create a service responsable for scheduling orders
